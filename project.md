# PeriopUDI Project Documentation

## Project Overview

**PeriopUDI** is a SMART-on-FHIR perioperative device documentation application designed to close the device-documentation gap in surgical settings. The system enables clinicians to scan medical device identifiers (UDI barcodes) and instantly capture FDA-validated device data into FHIR-conformant electronic health records with real-time FDA recall surveillance.

### Project Vision

> *PeriopUDI transforms a 30-second scan into a USCDI-conformant, GUDID-validated, recall-aware implantable device record — at the point of care, in the OR.*

---

## Project Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Streamline device documentation** - Reduce manual entry time from minutes to seconds via barcode scanning
2. **Ensure data accuracy** - Leverage FDA's GUDID database as the authoritative source for device metadata
3. **Enable FHIR conformance** - Create US Core v8.0.1 conformant Device resources automatically
4. **Provide clinical safety** - Real-time FDA recall surveillance via CDS Hooks to alert clinicians about device recalls before use
5. **Support clinical integration** - Full SMART-on-FHIR compatibility for EHR integration
6. **Demonstrate real-world value** - Pilot with clinical collaborators to prove operational benefit

### Secondary Goals
- Generate evaluation data for academic publication and competition submission
- Establish a model for perioperative technology that other institutions can adopt
- Contribute to the FHIR community and demonstrate US Core adoption

## Target Users & Use Cases

### Primary Users
- **Anesthesiologists** - Pre-operative device verification and risk assessment
- **Surgical nurses** - Device inventory and procedure tracking in the OR
- **Operating room staff** - Quick device information lookup without leaving the patient care area

### Key Use Cases

#### 1. Pre-Op Device Verification
**Scenario:** During pre-operative assessment, an anesthesiologist reviews a patient's implanted devices (pacemaker, ICD, stent, etc.) to determine perioperative risks.

**Current workflow:** Manual chart review, phone calls, unreliable information
**PeriopUDI solution:** 
- Scan the device (from the patient record or physical device)
- Automatic GUDID lookup returns manufacturer, model, MRI safety status
- FHIR Device resource created and linked to patient
- Timeline view shows all implanted devices with safety profiles

#### 2. Real-Time Recall Surveillance
**Scenario:** A patient arrives with a recalled implantable device.

**Current workflow:** Clinicians may not know about recent recalls
**PeriopUDI solution:**
- CDS Hooks service automatically checks patient's devices against daily FDA recall feed
- Critical Class I recalls trigger urgent warning cards
- Class II/III recalls show as advisories on the device timeline

#### 3. Device Inventory in the OR
**Scenario:** During a procedure, staff need to verify device details without leaving the OR.

**Current workflow:** Physical device lookup, incomplete information
**PeriopUDI solution:**
- Scan device barcode on package with phone
- Instant access to regulatory status, manufacturer info, device classification
- No app installation required, works with native camera

- **Clinical decision support systems** (generic, not device-specific)
- **Point-of-care clinical apps** (exist but not FHIR-based)

### PeriopUDI's Differentiation
1. **Workflow integration** - Scan → FHIR → Chart in one flow
2. **Standards-based** - SMART-on-FHIR + US Core + CDS Hooks (portable)
3. **Real-time recall** - Automatic surveillance, not manual lookup
4. **No installation** - Works with native phone camera (zero friction)
5. **Open source** - Inspectable, auditable, reproducible

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| GUDID API downtime | Device lookups fail | Fallback to local cache, graceful error messages |
| FHIR validation failure | Submission invalidated | Validate in CI on every commit, never ship invalid resources |
| HAPI data loss | Pilot data lost | Daily backups of Postgres, tested restore procedure |

### Clinical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Clinicians don't adopt | Pilot fails to generate data | Regular user feedback loops, UX iteration during pilot |
| Data privacy concern | Legal/regulatory block | Synthetic data only (Synthea), IRB non-human-subjects determination |
| Device recall misses | False negative on safety | Daily openFDA refresh, human review of demo recalls |

### Submission Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Missed AMIA deadline | Not accepted | Submission ready 1 week early, buffer for revisions |
| Demo video poor quality | Judges unimpressed | Professional recording, practice walkthrough, backup video |
| Judges unfamiliar with FHIR | Low score on tech | Clear explanations in submission, focus on clinical value |

## Known Limitations & Assumptions

### Limitations
- **Synthetic patients only** — No real patient data during pilot (by design for privacy)
- **Demo device set** — openFDA recall matching uses curated demo entries (production needs UDI-DI-keyed source)
- **Local HAPI only** — No connection to Epic/Cerner during pilot (Phase 6 adds SMART integration)
- **Single user** — No multi-user authentication in MVP (future enhancement)
- **No offline mode** — Requires internet for GUDID and FDA API lookups

### Assumptions
- **GUDID coverage** — Assumption that target implantable devices are in FDA GUDID (true for most, some older/niche devices may be missing)
- **QR readability** — Assumption that existing UDI barcodes on device packages are readable by phone camera (mostly true, some may need physical scanner)
- **Clinician internet access** — Assumption that OR has adequate WiFi for FHIR API calls (reasonable for modern ORs)
- **SMART-conformant EHR** — Assumption that target EHR supports SMART App Launch (true for Epic, Cerner, others)

---

## Metrics & Evaluation

### Quantitative Metrics (from Pilot)
- **Time-to-documentation:** Mean/median seconds from scan to FHIR Device created (target <15s)
- **Success rate:** % of scans that result in valid Device resource
- **Unique patients:** Count of distinct patients whose devices were documented
- **Unique devices:** Count of distinct UDIs successfully documented
- **Recall detection:** Sensitivity/specificity of CDS Hooks recall matching

### Qualitative Metrics
- **SUS score:** System Usability Scale (target ≥68)
- **Clinician quotes:** Direct feedback from pilot users
- **Workflow integration:** Perceived ease of integration into existing OR workflow
- **Safety concerns:** Any negative feedback on device recall alert accuracy or false positives

### Publication Metrics
- **Abstract:** 1,000 characters (fits AMIA abstract field)
- **Full paper:** Not required for AMIA competition (8-minute presentation instead)
- **Presentation:** 8 minutes, no Q&A, audience voting
